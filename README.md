### Hi, I'm Nintorch!
I'm a 21 years old programmer that likes to try new things and technologies!

I'm mostly a Python/C++/C# developer but I also can code in other programming languages
such as C or Kotlin.

I can speak Russian and English.

I also [try to help maintaining Godot Engine's input system!](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls/Nintorch)
